 * The template for displaying archive pages.
 *
 * Please note that various theme components may hijack this template and use a more specialized template like archive-jetpack-portfolio.php
 *
 * @link https://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Hierarchy
 *
 * This template part can be overridden by copying it to a child theme or in the same theme
 * by putting it in the root `/archive.php` or in `/templates/blog/archive.php`.
 * @see pixelgrade_locate_component_template()
 *
 * HOWEVER, on occasion Pixelgrade will need to update template files and you
 * will need to copy the new files to your child theme to
 * maintain compatibility. We try to do this as little as possible, but it does
 * happen. When this occurs the version of the template file will be bumped and
 * the readme will list any important changes.
