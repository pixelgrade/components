 * The template part used for displaying the entry header.
 *
 * This template part can be overridden by copying it to a child theme or in the same theme
 * by putting it in the root `/template-parts/entry-header.php` or in `/template-parts/blog/entry-header.php`.
 *
 * @see pixelgrade_locate_component_template_part()
 *
 * HOWEVER, on occasion Pixelgrade will need to update template files and you
 * will need to copy the new files to your child theme to
 * maintain compatibility. We try to do this as little as possible, but it does
 * happen. When this occurs the version of the template file will be bumped and
 * the readme will list any important changes.
